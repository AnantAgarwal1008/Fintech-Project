# Fintech-Project
It is a stock market prediction system that can predict the future price or directional movement (up/down) of a company’s stock based on how its past prices, financial indicators, and market sentiment have historically affected its value.                            1. Objective
Build a model that learns how:
Stock history (past prices, volume, volatility, and trends),
Financial indicators (P/E, P/B, ROCE, EPS, Dividend Yield, Debt-to-Equity, etc.), and
Market sentiment (positive or negative tone in news and reports about the company or its sector)
together affect stock price movements.
The model should use all of this information to predict the next price or direction of the stock.

2. Data
Use three main data sources:
Historical stock data 
Company financial data — key ratios and financial metrics.
News & sentiment data — collect articles, financial news, and sector updates.
Use NLP to extract sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral) and key topics.
Optionally use transformer models (like BERT or FinBERT) to analyze text.

3. Data Processing
Automatically collect and update data using APIs or web scraping.
Clean and align all data by date and company.

4. Modeling
Try different models:
Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM,etc.
Deep Learning: LSTM, GRU, or Transformer for time-series,etc.
Hybrid/Multimodal: Combine numeric (price & ratios) and text (sentiment) data.
Compare model performance and select the best-performing approach.

5. Output
Predict:
The next-day or next-week closing price, or
The price movement direction (Up / Down / Neutral).
Optionally show confidence or probability of each outcome.

6. Evaluation
Use time-based validation (walk-forward testing) to check performance over time.

7. Deliverables
A working data pipeline that collects and processes stock, financial, and news data.
Trained models with performance comparisons.
Visual charts for price trends, predictions, and sentiment.
A small dashboard or notebook for easy analysis.
